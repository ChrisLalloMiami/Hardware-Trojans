This directory contains scripts to run each test bench and the binary images
they expect to have. The scripts assume that the modelsim binary is included in
your PATH variable. The Altera Starter Edition of modelsim is installed
somewehre like the following by default:
  "~/altera/15.0/modelsim_ase/bin"
  "~/intelFPGA_lite/18.1/modelsim_ase/bin"

If you use the modelsim GUI you should launch it from this directory.


To test a single test bench:
$ ./run_test testbench_module_name

or a list of test benches:
$ ./run_test testbench_A testbench_B testbench_C

There are scripts to test all of the modules in a single folder. For example,
to test all of the modules in the rtl/common directory, run:
$ ./run_common

or all of the modules in the rtl/cores/base directory, run:
$ ./run_cores_base

To test every testbench and write results to run_all_output.txt, run:
$ ./run_all
